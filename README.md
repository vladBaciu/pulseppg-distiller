####   Accepted at UbiComp, ACM IMWUT, 2025. Please read our paper here: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3749494](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3749494).


Here is a quick [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_5XlucFPiGC10ZYD6nA9zy_CRpN7vOv1?usp=sharing) demonstrating how to run our code. Colab does not allow you to easily install packages with a specific environment, so the colab acts as a "controller" to run the codebase, as if it were a terminal environment. 

## 🔎 Code Overview
Below is an outline of the overall structure of our codebase. The code is nicely modularized with modular class-based configs that help define specific components of an experiment, such as a config for tuning the model training or a config for designing the network backbone. Extending this codebase to your own use-cases should be fairly straightforward.
                    
```

├── experiments/      
│   └── configs/     # Config for defining experiment
├── models/          # Training pipeline
│   └── RelCon/      # RelCon trainer for Pulse-PPG FM
│   └── MotifDist/

└── eval/            # Evaluation pipeline  
```

## 🛠️ Code Setup

Get started by cloning our codebase.

    git clone https://github.com/maxxu05/pulseppg.git
    cd pulseppg


### (A) Download Model Weights

The pre-trained model weights are available on Zenodo at this DOI [10.5281/zenodo.17270930](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17270930). Here we provide this bash script for your convenience for downloading and unpacking the weights. 

    bash ./download_pulseppg.sh


### (B) Python Environment

For this project we use miniconda to manage dependencies. [After installing miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#linux-2), we can install the pulseppg environment with the following terminal commands:

    conda env create -f env.yml
    conda activate pulseppg
    pip install -e . 

### (C) Download and Preprocess Evaluation Data

Here you can download and preprocess our public evaluation datasets:

    python pulseppg/data/process/PPGBP.py
    python pulseppg/data/process/PPGDALIA.py
    python pulseppg/data/process/SDB.py
    python pulseppg/data/process/WESAD.py

## 👨‍💻 Code Usage

### (A) Evaluate PulsePPG
In order to run our evaluations, after downloading the model weights or after re-training our model, simply run

    python run_exp.py --config pulseppg --retrain_eval

### (B) Evaluate PulsePPG with your own Evaluation data
In order to run evaluations on your own data, please add your data in `pulseppg/data/datasets` and add an `Eval_Config` in `experiments/out/PulsePPG_expconfigs.py`, then run `python run_exp.py --config pulseppg` again. Note that the configs are limited to linear probe right now, and fine-tuning will be added later for best task-specific performance.


### (C) Re-train PulsePPG with your own Pre-training data
If you want to re-run from scratch, change the `data_folder` parameter in `experiments/out/MotifDist_expconfigs.py` and `experiments/out/PulsePPG_expconfigs.py` TO YOUR OWN PRE-TRAINING DATA FOLDER. Ensure the new pre-training `data_folder` holds the same hierarchy (e.g. `train/subject_id/data_input_{i}.npy`). See `pulseppg/data/process/DUMMY.py` for more details on expected file hierarchy. 

PLEASE NOTE THAT PulsePPG was pre-trained with 4-minute-long data inputs BUT you can pre-train with any time length inputs (i.e. 30 seconds). This is because we use a temporal pooling mechanism that collapses the time dimension. 

After setting up the new `data_folder`, to retrain, simply run

    python run_exp.py --config motifdist --retrain
    python run_exp.py --config pulseppg --retrain


### TODO Code Additions
These will be added over the next few weeks or so. Feel free to follow-up on us via email or github, so we know that you are interested.
* Add interactive colab/ipynb for easier usage
* Add fine-tuning evals in
* Add PaPaGei and other Time-series FMs in


## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We are very grateful for the [PaPaGei](https://github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/papagei-foundation-model) codebase for constructing a robust PPG FM evaluation framework, which we used extensively to benchmark against. Thank you!
